# Dashboard Interface

This project is a modern, responsive dashboard built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Chart.js** (via **react-chartjs-2**), and **Material-UI Icons**. It demonstrates a clean user interface that adapts to different screen sizes by displaying a Sidebar on desktop and a Header on mobile. The dashboard displays various charts (Line, Pie, and Bar) and cards with metrics, along with simulated real-time data updates.
